<img src="https://github.com/keisukeYamagishi/Direction/blob/master/IMG_3437.PNG" width="30%" height="30%">

It is a library that makes it easy to conduct route search with the Google map SDK for iOS.
When creating an instance, you can display the route by passing the latitude and longitude of the departure point, the latitude and longitude of the arrival point as an argument, and calling the instance method.

```

If you do not have the google map SDK for iOS

```
target 'Target Name' do
  use_frameworks!
